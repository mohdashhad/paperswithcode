This is paperswithcode end to end project:
In the Chat Application in Java, we are going to make one-way client and server communication. So, the client sends a message to the server, and the server reads the message and prints it. Here, we will use two classes Socket and ServerSocket. The Socket class is used to communicate between the client and the server. With this class, we can read and write messages. The ServerSocket class is used on the server side.
